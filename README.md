Welcome

This is my repository for my third year undergraduate project for modelling irradiation damage.

I have used KMCLib (latest commit 9ce74cf9f27a29bffd8020194e225d36c384a854) https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib for my code. I have included a complied version for OS X 10.10.2 with clang, no MPI.

The model so far (12/02/15) is only a simple vacancies diffusion with an Fe bcc lattice.

TODO:

- include custom rate calculator to include vacancy clustering
- include second neighbours interactions
- include interstitials and their annihilation with vacancies (nearest neighbours)
- print out my required data
- complete CFG file format for atomeye visualisation (in progress)

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at txd283@bham.ac.uk
