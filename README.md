Welcome

This is my repository for my third year undergraduate project for modelling irradiation damage.

I have used KMCLib (latest commit 9ce74cf9f27a29bffd8020194e225d36c384a854) https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib for my code. 
I have included a complied version for OS X 10.10.2 (clang no MPI) and Ubuntu 14.04.2 64bit (gcc no MPI)

The model so far (26/02/15) does:

- vacancy clustering
- copper clustering for RPV steels
- CFG format output support for atomeye visualisation


TODO:

- include interstitials and their annihilation with vacancies (nearest neighbours)

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at txd283@bham.ac.uk
